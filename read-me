OVERVIEW:
This folder contains datasets used for analyzing the Canadian 3800 MHz spectrum auction. The files include bidder activity, bidding behavior, price evolution across rounds, product-level characteristics, and deployment cost information. The datasets support research on bidding strategies, valuation estimation, deployment incentives, and counterfactual auction simulations.

The information is based on ISED’s public auction releases and additional processed files prepared for analysis.

FILE DESCRIPTIONS

3800_all-bidder-clock-round-status.csv
This file contains bidder eligibility, activity levels, and status updates across all clock rounds. It is used to understand participation patterns and eligibility reduction over time.

3800_all-clock-round-bids.csv
This file includes all bids placed by all companies in each round. It is used for extracting bidder strategies, sequences of bundles, and valuation-related information.

3800_all-clock-round-results.csv
This file provides round results including posted prices, clock prices, aggregate demand, and increment percentages. It is used to reconstruct price evolution and identify overdemanded products.

3800_product-status.csv
This file contains product supply, start prices, posted prices, and clock prices for every round. It is used for calculating bundle costs and analyzing price trajectories for each product.

Service Deployment Cost Model.xlsx
This spreadsheet contains cost estimates for deploying spectrum services, including tower construction, equipment, and operating costs. It is used to model deployment-related expenses.

Tier 4 Deployment Requirements Met By Categorization.xlsx
This spreadsheet contains deployment thresholds and population information for service areas, including rural, remote, and urban classification. It is used to evaluate deployment coverage.

Tower Deployment_Replacement Costs.xlsx
This spreadsheet provides costs associated with tower construction or replacement. It is used for integrating infrastructure costs into valuation or deployment models.
